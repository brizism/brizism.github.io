        <p>I am a fan of natural products and it seemed like a good idea to create a website that would allow discovering natural makeup brands and products. This will also serve as a way to practice my Javascript skills. I like to design around real data when making sites and am keen to solve the big design problems as early as possible â€” especially the technical ones. The overall design uses a grid system to create a strong sense of alignment with SVG illustrations, generating a clean, a simple and elegant design that is also effective.</p>
